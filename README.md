# Autonomous Race Car

Project where I built an autonoumus race care that raced aroud any type of track containing different sized cones, it navigated the track using a LIDAR, and a raspberry pi was the brain of the car controlling the speed and the steering of the car. The car can be steered thorugh a GUI created in Python and it also visualizes what the results from the LIDAR.
